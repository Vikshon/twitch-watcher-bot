# twitch-watcher-bot

The idea of the project is to create a bot, that will watch streams in browserless mode, w/o loading the computer.

In this way, the bot will collect channels' points, which you can spent on gifts like games, clothes, even moderator role in some lucky cases.

Also, bot could collect twitch giveaways of games, where you must watch stream for some hours.
